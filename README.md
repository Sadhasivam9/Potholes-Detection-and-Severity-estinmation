# Potholes-Detection-and-Severity-estinmation
# Project Overview
This project aims to develop an efficient and accurate system for detecting potholes and estimating their severity using a deep learning-based approach. The system utilizes the YOLOv10 model to achieve real-time detection and classification of potholes in road images and videos.

# Features
Real-time pothole detection
Severity estimation (severe, moderate, mild)
Custom dataset with annotated potholes
Fine-tuned YOLOv10 model

# Dataset
The dataset consists of road images with labeled potholes, organized into training and validation sets.

# Results
The model achieves reasonable detection and classification accuracy, with specific performance metrics for each severity level of potholes.
